It was more than just a dessert—it was a tradition, a labor of love that she poured into every flaky crust and gooey, caramel-like filling.

<h2>Classic Pecan Pie Recipe</h2>

<h3>Servings and Timing</h3>
<p><strong>Servings:</strong> 8</p>
<p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 20 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 50–60 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Total Time:</strong> About 1 hour 20 minutes, plus cooling</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>For the Crust (or use a store-bought 9-inch pie crust):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
    <li>3–4 tablespoons ice water</li>
</ul>

<h4>For the Filling:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
    <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup light corn syrup (or dark for a deeper flavor)</li>
    <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups pecan halves (or coarsely chopped for easier slicing)</li>
    <li>Optional: 1–2 tablespoons bourbon or dark rum for extra depth (a common Southern touch)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>9-inch pie dish</li>
    <li>Mixing bowls</li>
    <li>Whisk or electric mixer</li>
    <li>Rolling pin (if making homemade crust)</li>
    <li>Pie weights or dried beans (for blind baking)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li><h4>Prepare the Crust:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, and salt. Cut in cold butter using a pastry cutter or fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with pea-sized butter pieces.</li>
    <li>Add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together. Form into a disc, wrap in plastic, and chill for at least 1 hour (or up to 2 days).</li>
    <li>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a 9-inch pie dish, trim excess, and crimp edges. Chill for 30 minutes to prevent shrinking.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Line the crust with parchment paper, fill with pie weights or dried beans, and blind bake for 15 minutes. Remove weights and parchment, then bake for 5 more minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Make the Filling:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk eggs and sugar until smooth. Add corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla, salt, and bourbon (if using). Stir until fully combined.</li>
    <li>Stir in pecans, ensuring they’re evenly distributed.</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Assemble and Bake:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>Pour the filling into the partially baked crust. Arrange any pecans on top for a prettier presentation if desired.</li>
    <li>Bake at 350°F for 50–60 minutes, until the center is set but slightly jiggly (it’ll firm up as it cools). If the crust browns too quickly, cover edges with foil or a pie shield after 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cool completely on a wire rack (at least 4 hours) before slicing to ensure clean cuts.</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Serve:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>Slice and serve at room temperature or slightly warmed, with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for that classic holiday feel.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for Grandma’s Touch</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Corn Syrup Choice:</strong> Light corn syrup gives a milder, sweeter flavor; dark corn syrup adds a molasses-like depth. If you’re unsure what your grandmother used, light is a safe bet for a classic taste.</li>
    <li><strong>Toasted Pecans:</strong> For extra flavor, lightly toast pecans in a dry skillet over medium heat for 3–5 minutes before adding to the filling.</li>
    <li><strong>Crust Variations:</strong> If your grandmother’s pie had a particularly flaky crust, ensure your butter stays cold and avoid overworking the dough. For a shortcut, a high-quality store-bought crust works well.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the pie at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the fridge for up to 4 days, covered tightly. Reheat slices gently in a 300°F oven for 10 minutes to revive the texture.</li>
</ul>
