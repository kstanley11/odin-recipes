    <h4>Let's kick our pecan pie up a notch with a splash of bourbon!</h4>
    <p>Pecan pie holds a special place in my heart as one of my all-time favorite desserts. Growing up, every holiday was made magical by the warm, nutty aroma of my grandmother’s pecan pie baking in the oven. It was more than just a dessert—it was a tradition, a labor of love that she poured into every flaky crust and gooey, caramel-like filling. No matter how full we were from the feast, we always saved room for a slice of that golden pie, topped with a dollop of whipped cream.</p>
    <p>Now, I’m on a mission to recreate her iconic dish and carry on her legacy. This recipe is my heartfelt attempt to capture the flavors and memories of those cherished holiday gatherings. With its buttery crust and rich, pecan-packed filling, this pie is a tribute to my grandmother’s kitchen and the joy she brought to our family table. Whether you’re a seasoned baker or a beginner, I hope this recipe helps you create your own moments of sweetness and connection.</p>
    <p>Join me in bringing this classic dessert to life. Below, you’ll find a detailed recipe inspired by my grandmother’s techniques, with tips to make it your own. Let’s bake a pie that fills your home with warmth and your heart with nostalgia—because some traditions are too delicious to let fade away.</p>
