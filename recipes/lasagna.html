    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a kick)</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>For the Cheese Filling:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h4>For Assembly:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles (no-boil or cooked according to package instructions)</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (for topping)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>9x13-inch baking dish</li>
    <li>Large pot (for boiling noodles, if not using no-boil)</li>
    <li>Large skillet or Dutch oven</li>
    <li>Mixing bowls</li>
    <li>Aluminum foil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li><h4>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add ground beef and Italian sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Cook until browned, about 7–8 minutes. Drain excess fat if desired.</li>
    <li>Add onion and garlic to the meat. Sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes (if using). Season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Set aside.</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Prepare the Cheese Filling:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1 cup mozzarella, ½ cup Parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix until smooth.</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Cook the Noodles (if not using no-boil):</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente, about 8–10 minutes. Drain and lay flat on a clean towel to prevent sticking.</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Assemble the Lasagna:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Spread a thin layer of meat sauce (about ¾ cup) on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Place 3–4 noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly if needed. Spread a layer of ricotta mixture (about ⅓ of the total), followed by a layer of meat sauce (about 1 cup), and sprinkle with ⅓ cup mozzarella.</li>
    <li>Repeat layers (noodles, ricotta, sauce, mozzarella) two more times, ending with a final layer of noodles topped with remaining meat sauce and 2 cups mozzarella mixed with remaining ¼ cup Parmesan for a cheesy top.</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Bake:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (tent to avoid touching cheese). Bake for 35 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 15–20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna cool for 15–20 minutes before slicing to set the layers.</li>
</ul>

<li><h4>Serve:</h4></li>
<ul>
    <li>Slice and serve warm, garnished with extra parsley if desired. Pair with garlic bread and a green salad for a complete meal.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3>Tips for the Perfect Lasagna</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Make-Ahead:</strong> Assemble the lasagna up to 1 day ahead, cover tightly, and refrigerate. Bake as directed, adding 10 minutes if baking cold.</li>
    <li><strong>Freezing:</strong> Freeze unbaked lasagna (well-wrapped) for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before baking, or bake from frozen, adding 20–30 minutes covered.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese Variations:</strong> For extra indulgence, mix in provolone or fontina with the mozzarella for a richer flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F for 15–20 minutes or microwave individual portions.</li>
</ul>
